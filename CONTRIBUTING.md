# Contributing to cw_tari_wallet

Thanks for contributing. This crate is the Tari wallet backend for
[Cake Wallet](https://cakewallet.com), so the bar is: **never break the public
Dart API**, and prove every PR is green and non-breaking. Read the
[README](./README.md) and [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) first.

## Prerequisites

- Rust stable (pinned by [`rust-toolchain.toml`](./rust-toolchain.toml); `rustup`
  applies it automatically) with the `rustfmt` and `clippy` components.
- `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` matching the FRB runtime in `Cargo.toml`
  (`=2.11.1`): `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --version 2.11.1`
  (or `make install`).
- Dart SDK `>=3.3.0` for the generated mock package.

## Public API stability policy

**The public Dart-facing API is a frozen contract. Changes are additive only.**

### What counts as the contract

- Every `pub` item in `crate::api` not marked `#[frb(ignore)]` — including
  functions **without** an explicit `#[frb]` attribute, because FRB v2 exports all
  public items in `crate::api` (e.g. `get_tip_info`, `is_node_synced`).
- Every input/output struct/enum and streamed event type: field names, types,
  order, and enum-variant shapes.
- The Dart-visible **error message strings** (FRB surfaces a thrown error's
  `Display` string; the internal `WalletError` is converted to `anyhow::Error` at
  the boundary and never returned directly).

### The rules

- **Additive only.** Add new functions/types/optional internal fields freely.
  Do **not** remove, rename, retype, or reorder anything in the contract; do not
  change an error string or the set/sequence of streamed events.
- **Safe to refactor freely** (NOT the contract): `#[frb(ignore)]` items
  (`start_scan_with_handler`, `send_transaction_with_handler`), `pub(crate)` items,
  private functions, and everything under `src/domain/**`.
- If a "better design" would change the contract, **don't apply it** — record it as
  a future, Cake-Wallet-coordinated proposal instead.

### How the CI guard works

- **bridge codegen drift** — CI runs `make gen` and fails if the committed
  `src/frb_generated.rs` / `.dart/**` is stale.
- **public API stability** — `scripts/check_api_stability.sh` diffs `.dart/api/**`
  against the PR's base ref and fails on any **removed/renamed declaration line**
  (function/class/enum/field/variant). Renames and retypes show up as a removed
  line, so they trip the guard.

### The escape hatch

A deliberate, coordinated break is the only exception. Coordinate the migration
with Cake Wallet, then add the **`breaking-api-approved`** label to the PR; CI then
sets `OVERRIDE=true` and the stability guard warns instead of failing. This makes a
break impossible to land *silently*.

## The codegen workflow

The Rust source and the generated bridge are committed together and must stay in
lockstep:

```sh
# 1. Edit the bridge surface under src/api/** (or its doc comments).
make gen          # 2. regenerate src/frb_generated.rs and .dart/**
# 3. Commit the regenerated output in the SAME change.
```

Doc comments on `#[frb]` items propagate into `.dart` as Dart doc comments — that
is additive and allowed, but you must still `make gen` and commit the result.

## Lint / test / build gate

Run all of these locally before opening a PR; CI runs the same:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                            # make fmt-check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  # make lint
cargo build --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace --all-features
cargo deny check                                            # licenses/advisories/bans
make gen && git diff --exit-code -- src/frb_generated.rs '.dart/**'   # zero drift
```

`--workspace` includes the `verify` end-to-end harness crate alongside
the library. `make help` lists all Makefile targets (`gen`, `watch`, `install`,
`clean`, `fmt`, `fmt-check`, `lint`, `check`, `record-fixtures`, `verify-live`).

## Testing expectations

See [docs/TESTING.md](./docs/TESTING.md) for the full strategy. The essentials:

- **No observable behavior change without a test.** Several tests are **contract
  guards** (e.g. `parse_network(None) -> MainNet`, the exhaustive enum mappings,
  the frozen error strings). If a change would flip one, the change is breaking —
  reconsider it rather than editing the test.
- Unit tests are colocated in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` and cover **pure logic
  only** (no network, no real DB, no global-state dependence). Test modules opt out
  of the strict wallet lints with
  `#![allow(clippy::unwrap_used, clippy::expect_used, clippy::panic)]`.
- Keep tests fast, hermetic, and deterministic. Derive fixtures (e.g. addresses)
  in-test from fixed bytes; never use a real funded address or a real seed.
- **Never put a real seed phrase or passphrase in a test or doctest.**

### End-to-end verification harness (`verify/` crate)

The `verify` workspace member exercises the **real frozen public API** the way
Cake Wallet does, with assertions — the runtime complement to the compile-time
bridge zero-diff guard. Three tiers:

- **Tier A — hermetic fixture replay** (`verify/tests/tier_a_fixture_replay.rs`):
  rebuilds a deterministic, **view-only** wallet DB into a temp dir, points the
  database path at it via `set_database_path` (and `unlock_wallet` where a key path
  is exercised), and asserts the read APIs
  (`list_wallets`, `get_address`, `get_balance`, `get_transactions`) return golden
  values, with `insta` snapshots pinning each DTO's shape + content.
- **Tier B — recorded/replayed RPC** (`verify/tests/tier_b_recorded_rpc.rs`): a
  local `wiremock` server returns committed JSON captures; `get_tip_info` /
  `is_node_synced` are pointed at it via `base_url` and asserted to parse.
- **Tier C — live-testnet smoke** (`verify` bin, feature `live-e2e`): opt-in,
  non-interactive scenario runner. Secrets come from env vars
  (`VERIFY_BASE_URL`, `VERIFY_SEED_WORDS`, `VERIFY_PASSPHRASE`), never interactive,
  never committed. **Never runs on PRs** — it runs on the nightly
  `nightly-live-e2e` workflow (and `make verify-live` locally).

Tiers A + B run on every PR via `cargo test --workspace`. Regenerate the committed
fixtures with `make record-fixtures` (only when golden values or the upstream RPC
shape change; see [`verify/fixtures/README.md`](./verify/fixtures/README.md)). The
committed `verify/fixtures/wallet.db` is a **view-only inspection snapshot** (no
spend keys, not byte-asserted); the tests rebuild it deterministically.

## Branch protection

`main` is protected. A maintainer configures GitHub branch protection to require
all of the following status checks to pass before merge (the names match the CI
jobs in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)):

- `rustfmt`
- `clippy`
- `build`
- `test`
- `cargo-deny`
- `forbidden crates`
- `release scripts`
- `bridge codegen drift`
- `public API stability`

The `breaking-api-approved` label is the only sanctioned way to merge a
deliberate, coordinated API break (see above).

## Commit & PR conventions

- Write imperative, scoped commit messages (e.g. "Add rename_wallet()"). Keep a
  PR to one logical change.
- Each PR must: regenerate and commit the bridge, pass the lint/test/build gate,
  and add a test for any behavior change.
- Do **not** hand-edit generated files (`src/frb_generated.rs`, `.dart/**` except
  `.dart/pubspec.yaml`) — change the `#[frb]` source and regenerate.

## Architecture & code layout

- `src/api/**` — the FRB boundary: public functions, DTOs, `From` conversions.
- `src/domain/**` — pure, bridge-free, global-state-free logic (parameters in,
  values/`WalletError` out).
- `src/api/error.rs` — the internal `WalletError`.
- `src/api/config.rs` — the single source of truth for default constants.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full picture.

## Dependency & release management

Dependencies and releases are kept on a sustainable, automated footing. The CI
gate (above) — **especially the bridge codegen-drift and public-API-stability
checks** — is the thing that proves a dependency bump did not leak a change into
the frozen contract. Never bypass it on a dependency PR.

### Pinning & the lockfile

- `Cargo.lock` is **committed**, and stays committed. This crate is an *artifact
  producer* (it compiles to the native libs linked by the Flutter app), not a
  reusable library — so the lockfile is the reproducible-build record, not noise to
  be ignored. A reusable library would `.gitignore` it; we must not.
- `minotari-wallet-core` is pinned by **git rev** (with `default-features = false,
  features = ["http"]`; the `forbidden crates` CI job fails if `Cargo.lock` gains
  `openssl-sys`, `native-tls`, `utoipa-swagger-ui`, `axum`, `clap`, `tonic` or
  `prost`); `tari_common` / `tari_common_types` /
  `tari_hashing` / `tari_transaction_components` are pinned **exactly** to the
  `=6.3.0-pre.1` pre-release the `minotari` rev builds against (a caret pin would
  resolve to a later pre-release or final, which that rev does not compile with; the transitive
  `tari_*` crates are held at `6.3.0-pre.1` in `Cargo.lock`);
  `flutter_rust_bridge` is pinned **exactly** `=2.11.1`.

### FRB runtime ↔ codegen CLI lockstep

The `flutter_rust_bridge` **runtime** version in `Cargo.toml` (`=2.11.1`) and the
`flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` **CLI** version used to run `make gen` must be the
**same**. A skewed CLI reformats the generated output and the **bridge codegen
drift** CI job fails spuriously. The CLI version is pinned in CI as
`FRB_CODEGEN_VERSION` in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
and in the install instructions in the [README](./README.md#prerequisites). When
FRB is bumped, all three move **in the same PR**: `Cargo.toml`,
`FRB_CODEGEN_VERSION`, and the README/CONTRIBUTING install lines. Renovate flags
the FRB crate with the `frb-coordinated-bump` label and never auto-merges it for
exactly this reason — treat it as a manual, coordinated bump.

### Bumping `minotari` (and the `tari_*` crates)

The Tari upstream moves fast and ships breaking changes. A bump that *compiles* can
still break the contract (e.g. a renamed enum variant flowing into a DTO), so the
process is:

1. Update the `rev` (for `minotari`) or the version (for `tari_*`) and run
   `cargo update` for the affected crates only.
2. **Re-verify the `From<minotari::…>` conversions first** — they are the parts
   that break on upstream enum/struct drift. The files to check, in order:
   - `src/api/transactions.rs` (5 `From` impls, incl. the 7-variant
     `DisplayedTransactionStatus`),
   - `src/api/balance.rs`, `src/api/fee.rs`, `src/api/scanner.rs`,
     `src/api/base_node.rs`.
3. The **enum-mapping / characterization tests** are the regression
   guard rail — `cargo test --all-features` must stay green. If a mapping test
   would have to change, upstream changed a shape that flows into the contract:
   stop and treat it as a (forbidden) breaking change, not a test edit.
4. Run the full gate, then `make gen` and commit the regenerated bridge. What is
   actually enforced is **no removed/renamed declaration line** under
   `.dart/api/**` (`scripts/check_api_stability.sh`, see "How the CI guard works"),
   not a byte-for-byte zero diff. A zero `.dart/**` diff is the common and
   preferred outcome, but a bump can legitimately move *non-declaration* lines —
   most often the `// These functions are ignored because they are not marked as
   `pub`: …` comment block flutter_rust_bridge emits, which shifts whenever a
   private helper or a trait impl is added or removed. Read the diff and confirm
   every changed line is a comment; **any** changed or removed declaration line
   (function, class/enum, field, variant) means the bump leaked a contract change —
   revert, or promote to a MAJOR only via a coordinated migration (see below).

Pre-release `tari_*` (`6.3.0-pre.1`) can change shape between pre-releases — never
auto-merge a `tari_*` bump.

### Refresh `webpki-roots` every release

Base-node TLS trusts the CA bundle compiled in through `webpki-roots` (not the OS
store; see `docs/THREAT_MODEL.md`). Before tagging each release, run
`cargo update -p webpki-roots`, so removed or distrusted CAs drop out and new ones
arrive, and commit the `Cargo.lock` change with the release.

### Dependency-update automation (Renovate)

[`renovate.json`](./renovate.json) opens validated dependency PRs that the CI
matrix gates:

- Routine crates.io patch/minor updates are **grouped** into one weekly PR (PR
  concurrency and hourly rate are limited) to keep noise manageable.
- `flutter_rust_bridge` (label `frb-coordinated-bump`) and the `tari_*` crates
  (label `tari-stack-bump`) are isolated into their own PRs and **never
  auto-merged** — they need the manual lockstep / `From`-conversion review above.
- A custom manager tracks the git-pinned `minotari-cli` rev and proposes digest
  (rev) updates from its default branch.

### `cargo deny` / advisory policy

- CI runs `cargo deny check` as a merge gate
  ([`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml), `cargo-deny` job) and
  [`audit.yml`](./.github/workflows/audit.yml) runs `cargo deny check advisories`
  daily to surface new RUSTSEC advisories without waiting for a PR.
- The git `sources` allow-list in [`deny.toml`](./deny.toml) permits exactly the
  `minotari-cli` git source; anything else is denied.
- The `[advisories].ignore` list holds **only** transitive advisories with no safe
  upgrade available (currently five *unmaintained* crates pulled by the Tari
  stack). Before adding an entry, first try a semver-compatible
  `cargo update -p <crate> --precise <patched>` — a lockfile bump that fixes the
  advisory is always preferred over an ignore (the bridge zero-diff guard proves it
  did not touch the contract). Revisit and prune the list on every `minotari` /
  `tari_*` bump. See the header comment in `deny.toml` for the full procedure.

### Versioning & changelog

The crate version tracks the **frozen public contract**, not internal refactors.
See [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full policy; in short: additive
contract changes are **MINOR**, internal-only changes (refactors, dependency bumps,
CI, docs, non-leaking security fixes) are **PATCH**, and a breaking contract change
is a **MAJOR** that is forbidden outside a Cake-Wallet-coordinated migration carrying
the `breaking-api-approved` trail. Record every notable change in `CHANGELOG.md`
under `[Unreleased]` in the same PR.

### Native release artifacts

Pushing a `v*` tag runs [`release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml), which
publishes a GitHub release Cake Wallet downloads instead of compiling Rust:

| Asset | Contents |
|---|---|
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-android.zip` | `jniLibs/{arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,x86_64}/libminotari_wallet_ffi.so` (NDK 28.2.13676358, API 21) |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-ios.zip` | `minotari_wallet_ffi.xcframework`: dynamic frameworks for device arm64 and simulator arm64+x86_64 (iOS 12) |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-macos.zip` | universal (arm64 + x86_64) `libminotari_wallet_ffi.dylib` (macOS 13) |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-linux-x86_64.zip` | x86_64 `libminotari_wallet_ffi.so` |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-linux-aarch64.zip` | aarch64 `libminotari_wallet_ffi.so` |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-windows.zip` | x86_64 MSVC `minotari_wallet_ffi.dll` |
| `cw_tari_wallet-<tag>-dart.zip` | the committed FRB Dart bindings, i.e. the repo's `.dart/` at the tagged commit, unpacked to `dart/` (`dart/api/*.dart`, `dart/frb_generated.dart`, `dart/frb_generated.io.dart`, `dart/frb_generated.web.dart`, `dart/pubspec.yaml`) |
| `SHA256SUMS` | checksums of every zip; check the ones you downloaded with `sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS` (macOS: `shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`) |

Every zip and `SHA256SUMS` also carries a GitHub build-provenance attestation.
`SHA256SUMS` alone lives in the same mutable release as the zips, so check provenance
with:

```sh
gh attestation verify <zip> --repo tari-project/cw_tari_wallet \
  --cert-identity https://github.com/tari-project/cw_tari_wallet/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/<tag> \
  --source-digest <commit sha> --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

(The release notes print this command with the tag and commit SHA filled in.) It
checks that the file's digest was attested on a GitHub-hosted runner by exactly
`.github/workflows/release.yml` of this repository, running for `refs/tags/<tag>` at
`<commit sha>`. `--cert-identity` is an exact match. Avoid `--signer-workflow`: it
matches as an unanchored pattern, so a look-alike workflow such as
`release-yml-lint.yml` would pass. Without these flags, any workflow on any branch
of this repo could produce an attestation the command accepts. The command does not
check who pushed the tag, so the identity only means "built from the released tag"
once the `v*` tag ruleset below restricts who can create `v*` tags. Cake Wallet should still
pin each version's sha256 in its own repository rather than trust the release page
at download time, and immutable releases should be on.

The release notes list the tag's commit SHA, the `minotari-wallet-core` rev, the
FRB and rustc versions, every locked `tari_*` version, and each zip's size with the change
from the previous tag ([`scripts/release/release_notes.py`](./scripts/release/release_notes.py)).

- **One network group.** Every library is built with `TARI_TARGET_NETWORK=mainnet`.
  `tari_common` fixes the accepted networks at compile time, so the bundle accepts
  only `MainNet` and `StageNet` (chosen at runtime). For Esmeralda, build locally
  with `TARI_TARGET_NETWORK=testnet make release-<platform>`. The `make release-*`
  targets default to `mainnet`; `scripts/release/build.sh` refuses anything else and
  fails if `tari_common` did not report a MainNet build.
- **No downloads during the build.** The job runs `cargo fetch --locked`, then builds
  with `CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true` and the network blocked, so an accidental download
  (for example a build script fetching an asset) fails the release. This is
  detection, not a security boundary: a deliberately hostile build script could get
  around it (Linux builds keep the runner user's passwordless sudo, Windows builds
  run as admin, and the macOS profile allows everything except remote
  connections). Linux runners (Android, Linux x86_64/aarch64) build in a network
  namespace with no network; macOS runners (iOS, macOS) build under `sandbox-exec`
  with [`scripts/release/offline.sb`](./scripts/release/offline.sb), which denies
  every connection except to localhost; the Windows runner switches the firewall to
  default-deny outbound and restores it afterwards. While blocked, Windows allows only
  DNS, the GitHub runner processes, and programs that already held an outbound
  connection when the block was applied (shells and build tools excluded; the job log
  lists them). Each job first checks that `https://index.crates.io` returns no HTTP
  response at all and fails if it does. The tag must equal `v` + the `Cargo.toml` version,
  and `scripts/check_forbidden_crates.sh` runs first.
- **Least privilege.** CI and the release builds get a read-only token, and
  checkouts never persist credentials. Each build uploads its own artifact; the
  `assemble` job ([`scripts/release/assemble.sh`](./scripts/release/assemble.sh))
  fails unless each holds only that platform's zip and rustc version, then writes
  `SHA256SUMS` and the notes without a write token. Only the final `publish` job,
  which runs on a pushed tag and in the `release` environment, can write. It checks
  that the downloaded bundle matches the digests `assemble` recorded and every file
  is listed in `SHA256SUMS`. It also checks that the tag still points at the built
  commit, then attests the files and creates the release. Every action is pinned to
  a commit SHA, and Renovate keeps those pins updated. The `check` job also runs
  `cargo deny check advisories`, so an advisory published after the commit's CI
  still blocks the release.
- **Residual risks.**
  - `assemble.sh`'s per-artifact check catches name collisions and one job
    supplying another platform's files. It does not stop a build job that is itself
    malicious: that job runs with sudo or admin rights and a token able to touch the
    run's artifacts. A malicious dependency could trojan every platform anyway. The
    digest check in `publish` only covers what happens after `assemble`.
  - The tag re-check narrows, but does not close, the window in which a tag can be
    moved between build and publish. The `v*` tag ruleset and immutable releases
    close it.
  - CI installs `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` through `taiki-e/install-action`
    (a binstall fallback) without a checksum, so the codegen-drift check trusts that
    upstream binary. The worst case is stale bindings passing the check, not code
    injected into the release.
  - If the real publish fails with "release already exists", something else
    created that release: treat it as compromised, delete it, and investigate before
    re-running.
- **Reproduce one platform locally** with `scripts/release/build.sh <platform> <tag>
  <out-dir>` (Android needs `ANDROID_NDK_HOME`; iOS needs Xcode).

To release: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml`, move the `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the
new version and merge to `main`. Once CI is green on that `main` commit, run the
**Release** workflow by hand (Actions → Release → Run workflow) on it: a manual run
is always a dry run, even on a tag. It builds and packages everything as `dryrun`
and prints the notes, but publishes nothing. Once it is green, push the tag
`v<version>` on the same commit. Only a pushed tag publishes. The release fails
unless the tagged commit is on `main` **and** CI's `bridge codegen drift`,
`forbidden crates` and `cargo-deny` jobs all succeeded in `ci.yml`'s own run for
the push of that exact commit to `main` (look-alike check runs from other workflows
do not count)
([`scripts/release/require_ci_green.sh`](./scripts/release/require_ci_green.sh)). The
codegen-drift check is what guarantees the shipped Dart bindings match the Rust. If
CI is still running or has not run on the commit, the release stops and asks you to
wait. `main` currently has no branch protection, so being on `main` alone proves
nothing.

**Recommended repository settings.** A maintainer applies these by hand; the
workflow cannot enforce them, and until they exist anyone who can push a `v*` tag can
publish:

- **`release` environment:** add required reviewers, and a deployment rule that
  allows only `v*` tags. The workflow already uses this environment; GitHub creates
  it without protection until it is configured. Reviewers only gate jobs that
  declare the environment: another workflow merged to `main` can still ask for
  `contents: write` or `id-token: write` itself. Pair this with the branch protection
  below (required review) and a `CODEOWNERS` entry that sends `.github/workflows/**`
  changes to the release maintainers.
- **Tag ruleset for `v*`:** restrict creating, updating and deleting matching tags to
  maintainers.
- **Branch protection on `main`:** require the CI checks listed under
  [Branch protection](#branch-protection).
- **Actions → General → Workflow permissions:** default token = read, and do not let
  GitHub Actions create or approve pull requests.
- **Releases:** turn on immutable releases, so a published release's assets and tag
  cannot be changed.

## Deferred / future work

- **Explicit-network send.** `parse_network(None) -> MainNet` and the
  network-independent `DEFAULT_BASE_URL` are frozen. A future **additive**
  explicit-network function (and network-derived base URL) would be a
  Cake-Wallet-coordinated change, not a behavior change to the existing functions.

### Proposals raised by the `minotari af78477` / `tari_* 5.7.0-pre.8` security review

Each of these would change the frozen contract, so none is implemented. They need a
Cake-Wallet-coordinated migration (and the `breaking-api-approved` trail if a change
is not purely additive).

- **Type the secrets crossing the FFI.** Done for sends and scans in v0.2.0
  (SPEC-10): they use the wallet's key session and take no seed words or
  passphrase. Passphrases still cross as plain `String`s to `unlock_wallet`,
  `change_passphrase`, `abandon_send` and the create/restore/import functions, and
  seed words to `restore_wallet`.
- **Honour upstream's replay binding.** `build_unsigned_transaction` mints a fresh
  random `Uuid` per attempt, discarding upstream's idempotency mechanism: two
  identical send attempts are two independent reservations rather than one
  idempotent operation. Deriving the key from the request (as upstream's
  `IdempotencyOperation` fingerprint does) would make a retried send safe, but the
  key would need to be caller-supplied or caller-visible.
- **Validate `base_url` and stop trusting `accepted: true`.** `base_url` is accepted
  unvalidated, so a plaintext `http://` endpoint is permitted; and the node's
  `accepted: true` response is treated as proof of broadcast. Rejecting non-TLS
  endpoints would break any caller currently passing `http://`, so it needs
  coordination.
